          # --- Styling with available inputs ---
          # Use a dark template/preset. 'base: header' might also help with dark headers.
          template: "classic" # Use classic, dark, or some other dark theme if available and works
          base: "header" # Keeps header dark if template allows
          config_display: "block" # As per your image
          config_timezone: "Asia/Kolkata"

          # --- Plugins ---
          # Achievements plugin (for trophies like Super Committer, Super Star)
          plugin_achievements: yes
          # Note: 'plugin_achievements_colors' is not a valid input,
          # so trophies will use default theme colors or be based on 'accent' if it existed.
          # We can't customize them directly with this version.
          # We'll rely on the overall dark theme to make them fit.

          # Notable plugin (for Commits, Stars, Repositories, etc.)
          plugin_notable: yes
          # Note: 'plugin_notable_max' is not a valid input.
          # We'll rely on the default max or a theme setting.
          plugin_notable_indepth: yes
          # filter what to display
          plugin_notable_filter: stars,commits,repositories,followers,issues,pull_requests,reviews,experience


          # Isocalendar plugin (if you want the contribution graph below the stats, similar to your snake)
          plugin_isocalendar: yes
          plugin_isocalendar_duration: full-year
          # Note: 'plugin_isocalendar_colors' is not a valid input for this version.
          # It will use theme's default colors for the heatmap.
